          History Of Traditional Business Cards
        </h2>

        <p>
          With a history rooted in China from the early 15th century, “Meishi”
          cards were used for self-promotion and building relationships, which
          became popularly known as “Visiting Cards” in Europe. As societies
          changed and the lines between social and business interactions
          blurred, the need for a singular, all-purpose card emerged, leading to
          the development of the business card.
        </p>

        <p>
          From simple paper or wooden cards with handwritten calligraphy to the
          current colorful designs and new age e-cards with graphics, these
          advancements reflect the intersectional changes between technology and
          society.
