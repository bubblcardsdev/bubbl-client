Our service offers a modern alternative to traditional paper business cards, enabling users to share their details instantly through smartphones with just a tap. Bubbl combines technology with networking to create meaningful professional connections in today's digital-first world.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to download any app to use this product?",
      answer:
        "No, you don't need to download a separate app to use Bubbl. Our platform works through web browsers, making it accessible on any device with internet connectivity. Recipients of your digital business card can view your profile instantly without installing anything. This approach ensures maximum compatibility and convenience for both you and your contacts.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long it will take to receive my products?",
      answer:
        "Physical Bubbl products (such as NFC-enabled cards or tags) typically ship within 2-3 business days after order confirmation. Delivery time depends on your location, but most customers receive their products within 5-7 business days. Your digital profile is available immediately after registration, allowing you to start sharing your digital business card right away, even before your physical products arrive.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What features does Bubbl offer for user customization and interaction?",

        "Bubbl offers extensive customization options including personalized profiles with custom colors, fonts, and layouts. Users can add social media links, portfolio items, videos, and downloadable files. Our interactive features include direct contact options, appointment scheduling integration, and real-time analytics to track engagement. Premium users can access advanced customization tools such as custom domains and animated elements to make their digital business cards truly unique.",

They provide real-time updates, so your contacts always have your current information. They offer enhanced tracking and analytics to see who views your profile. Digital cards can include much more information than physical cards, including portfolios, videos, and booking links. They're also cost-effective in the long run, eliminating the need for reprinting when your information changes.",
